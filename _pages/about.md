I turned 61 this year, and suddenly the ever-present desire for a single place to hold my thoughts, which now disappear faster than I can right them down, becomes more... urgent. I have no illusions as to the value of my thoughts, I know I have nothing to say that hadn't been said before, simply because everything that seems important to me these days had beed covered in great detail by ancient philosophers from Socrates to early Christians, and then revisited between Renaissance and modern times by more philosophers from Michel de Montaigne to Pierre Hadot. But my thoughts are simply their thoughts in my head, and I already feel that they are vanishing, so I need to hold on to them in a written form to be able to revisit them all in one place. So I created this website, put Montaigne's hat on and started to write. This website is my attempt to create a data dump for my thoughts and favorite quotes which I cannot hold in my mind. Everyone is welcome to read, of course, but this is a place primarily for myself. I might get bored and stop writing tomorrow, or I may keep writing until I die 
(which may also be tomorrow :)), I am not sure, but, as Dante said "It pleases me as much to doubt as to know".
