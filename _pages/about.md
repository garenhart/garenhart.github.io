This is a collection of thoughts and quotes on important to me topics. This kind of note taking was known to ancient Greek and Roman philosophers as hypomnemata (memory aids). To the best of my knowledge, the word hypomnemata itself was recently popularized (in philosophical literature :)) by the two great French philosophers of the XX century Michel Foucault and Pierre Hadot. The most prominent Stoics, such as Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, have been known for this kind of writing. Contemporary blog format seems suitable for the purpose, although the usual chronological hierarchy is hardly relevant here. If you are reading this, it likely means you found this site/page by accident, but by all means keep reading for as long as it pleases you, it would only make me happy to know that someone finds any of this useful or enjoyable.
