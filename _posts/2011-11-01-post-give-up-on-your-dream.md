An advice seemingly opposite to what contemporary motivational ideas suggest, but in fact more useful:
 While chasing your dreams and trying to achieve your goals are important targets in life, it is even more important to set an expiration date for each goal, otherwise you'll keep missing opportunities in your life by staying focused on this one goal. If by the expiration time you didn't achieve your goal, stop, re-evaluate, set a new target, and don't forget to set a new expiration time. Now you have a slightly better chance of achieving your new goal, since you know a little better what you cannot do, and knowing what you cannot do is even more important than knowing what you can, because by learning your limits you descend from the clouds closer to the ground and your steps forward will become firmer.
