>What are Alexander, Caesar, and Pompey when compared to Diogenes, Heraclitus, and Socrates? For these latter viewed all things in terms of both matter and cause, and their ruling centres were self-determined. As to the others, consider how many cares they had and to how many things they were enslaved!
