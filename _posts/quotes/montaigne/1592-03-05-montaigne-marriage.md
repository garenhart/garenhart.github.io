> I know no marriages which fail and come to grief more quickly than those which are set on foot by beauty and amorous desire. Marriage requires foundations which are solid and durable; and we must keep on the alert. That boiling rapture is no good at all. 

> <cite>Michel de Montaigne [Essays III, 5. On some lines of Virgil]</cite>
