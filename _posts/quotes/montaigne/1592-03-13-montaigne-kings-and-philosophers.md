> Kings and philosophers shit: and so do ladies.[^1]

> <cite>Michel de Montaigne [Essays III, 13. On experience]</cite>

[^1]: "Les Roys et les philosophes fientent, et les dames aussi." The original French statement is more direct and earthy than some of the English translations suggest. "Fientent" is quite blunt - it means to defecate or excrete waste. Montaigne's French maintains that characteristic directness and earthiness that made his writing so distinctive and humanistic.
