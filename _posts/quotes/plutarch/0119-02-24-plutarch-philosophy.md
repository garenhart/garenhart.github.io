> ...philosophy is the only cure for the maladies and disorders of the soul. For with her as ruler and guide we can know what is honorable, what is disgraceful; what is just, what unjust; generally speaking, what is to be sought after, what to be avoided.

> <cite>Plutarch, Morals, On Education</cite>
