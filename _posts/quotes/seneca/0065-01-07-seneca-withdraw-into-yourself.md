> ...you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve.

> <cite>Seneca, Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, VII. ON CROWDS</cite>
