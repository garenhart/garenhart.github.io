> That which takes effect by chance is not an art. Now wisdom is an art; it should have a definite aim, choosing only those who will make progress, but withdrawing from those whom it has come to regard as hopelessâ€”yet not abandoning them too soon, and just when the case is becoming hopeless trying drastic remedies.
