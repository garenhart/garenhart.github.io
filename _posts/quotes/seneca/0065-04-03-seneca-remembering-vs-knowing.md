> Remembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the memory; knowing, however, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon the copy and not all the time glancing back at the master. "Thus said Zeno, thus said Cleanthes, indeed!"

> <cite>Seneca, Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium, XXXIII. ON THE FUTILITY OF LEARNING MAXIMS</cite>
