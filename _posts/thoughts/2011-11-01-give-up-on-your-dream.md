> As we embark on the journey towards fulfilling our goals, it is important that we set an expiration date for each of these objectives, otherwise we risk becoming ensnared in an unyielding pursuit, to the detriment of other opportunities that may arise in our lives.<br>
Should we find ourselves approaching the deadline without having achieved the goal, it is essential that we take a step back, reassess our approach, and set a new goal. But in doing so, we need to remember to assign a new expiration date, for it is only by recognizing the boundaries of our capabilities we are able to set a goal that is both realistic and attainable.
