> As technology advances, human attention spans are shrinking, yet there is still a desire to appear wise without exerting much effort. This is why the internet is flooded with short, clever-sounding quotes from historical figures, often taken out of context and losing their original meaning. For example, [a quote from Montaigne](https://libquotes.com/michel-de-montaigne/quote/lbe4n5p){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, when read in [the context of its full essay]({% link _posts/quotes/montaigne/1592-03-08-montaigne-stupid-people.md %}), holds much deeper significance. A longer attention span is necessary to truly understand and appreciate such quotes.
