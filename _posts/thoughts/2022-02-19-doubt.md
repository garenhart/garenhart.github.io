> Doubt is not a transitory stage in the quest for truth, but a permanent state of mind. This concept, highly valued by the Stoics, as well as by Dante and Montaigne: ([On doubt]({% link _posts/quotes/montaigne/1592-01-26-montaigne-doubt.md %}), [There is nothing certain]({% link _posts/quotes/montaigne/1592-02-14-montaigne-nothing-certain.md %}), [From bad to uncertain]({% link _posts/quotes/montaigne/1592-03-09-montaigne-from-bad-to-uncertain.md %})), is often misunderstood in today's world where uncertainty is usually perceived as a sign of weakness.
