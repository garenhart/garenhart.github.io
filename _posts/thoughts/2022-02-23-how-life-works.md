> Here is how life works. You are born, then you live for a while (for decades, if you are lucky), then you die. And none of this is up to you, this is the way it happens to everyone, short and tall, rich and poor, smart and stupid. Now comes the best part and you are in total control here: It is completely up to you to be happy on the way to your certain death, or to endlessly worry about it's inevitability.
