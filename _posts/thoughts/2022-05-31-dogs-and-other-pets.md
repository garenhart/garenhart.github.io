> As I walked around Fresh Pond in Cambridge, a runner caught my eye. He was accompanied by a large canine, who loped along at a comfortable distance. I recognized the duo as frequent visitors to the pond, their daily routine a familiar sight to me.<br>The dog suddenly veered off into the dense trees to poop. The runner, noticing his companion's departure, quickly turned around and disappeared into the foliage in search for the poop. I continued my walk, my thoughts wandering as I left the pair behind. Minutes later, the runner passed by again, with a large bag of poop in his hand.<br>
I couldn't help but reflect on the scene I had just witnessed. Two millennia ago, [Caesar would have been incredulous at the sight of wealthy foreigners doting on their lapdogs and monkeys]({% link _posts/quotes/plutarch/0118-02-23-plutarch-caesar-on-pets.md %}), but now we have come to expect to see people cleaning up after their pets. Is this a sign of progress? Or is it a sign of regression? <br>
