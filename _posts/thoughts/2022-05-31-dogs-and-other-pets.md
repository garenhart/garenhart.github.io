Then the dog went into the woods to poop. The runner noticed and turned around, but by the time he was back the dog was done pooping, so the dog-owner-runner went into the woods in search for the poop. Meanwhile I kept walking and left them behind. Couple of minutes later the duo passed by again, now the dog-owner-runner-responsible-citizen proudly running with a large bag of dog poop (the dog was big). The thought "What a good citizen, picking up his dog's poop even from the woods" was not among the thoughts that crossed my mind, neither was "What a looser, picking up his dog's poop even from the woods". What was among my thoughts is "How could we get here two millennia after the Caesar's disbelief about affectionate pet owners, or at least the [Plutarch's interpretation of it]({% link _posts/quotes/plutarch/0119-02-24-plutarch-caesar-on-pets.md %})?
