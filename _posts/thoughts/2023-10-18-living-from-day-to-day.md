I was watching a documentary about David Bowie, and he said something that really resonated with me:

> **I think it's an heroic act [...] to be able to obtain enthusiasm and joy from the actual process of living from day to day. I try [...] I think it takes practice and concentration [...] to enjoy it. [It] is very easy to fall into the trap of looking for one's dreams and always thinking of a future moment when everything  will be better. And if the process is not enjoyed, the dreams will never come to anything. And by enjoying the process, you are creating a dream come true.**[^1]
